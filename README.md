I recommend having the updated version of powershell for this. 
  winget install Microsoft.PowerShell

You will also need FFMPEG in one of the four places.
        "C:\\ffmpeg\\ffmpeg.exe",
        "C:\\ffmpeg\\bin\\ffmpeg.exe",
        "C:\\Program Files\\ffmpeg\\bin\\ffmpeg.exe",
        "C:\\Program Files (x86)\\ffmpeg\\bin\\ffmpeg.exe",

Finally this is an ongoing project so I will be updating it constantly until 1.0. After I will start making branches so I dont mess anything up too much.
